# Introduction - what is ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that aims to encrypt a victim's files in such a way that their computer, or access to their files, is disabled. A message is then displayed, serving as the ransom note, giving detailed instruction as to how the victim can retrieve their computer or files. Usually this is done by paying a ransom to the criminals behind the attack. [[@okaneEvolutionRansomware2018]]


# A brief history of ransomware
The founder of ransomware, Joseph Popp, originally created a Trojan with a ransomware called "AIDS" in 1989. He used a floppy disc as an attack vector and after it encrypted the victim's C: drive, it demanded 189 USD to be sent to a postbox in Panama. There were a number of problems with this, including a low number of reachable victims, a weak infection method, a weak encryption and the payment method.  Safe to say, the world has moved on since then. 

In modern times, the use of ransomware has exploded with a 600% increase ransomware "families" betewen 2013 and 2018. The internet has created a target rich environment and an easy attack vector for such malware. Furthermore, encryption software has lowered the entry skills required and cryptocurrencies provide easy and anonymous payment methods to the advantage of the attacker. There is also the fact that most businesses, organizations and people now store their data electronically [[@okaneEvolutionRansomware2018]]

# Mitigation
In the early stages of an attack, removal of the malware can stop further damage to the data.

Proper backups are critical. Preferably offline, as not to be reached by the ransomware.

- Security updates.
- Education of personell 
- Mitigate spread


## File system defences against ransomware
A good backup is important for protecting against ransomware. For this reason, the ransomware usually targets the backups as well if it can reach them. Measures like limiting user access to backups and software related to backups might be effective measures. 

## File decryption and recovery

It is possible to use tools for decrypting and recovering files through software such as https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/index.html suggested by Nettvett.no.

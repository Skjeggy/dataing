The number of attackers who rely on social engineering has risen 25% since 2019, and phishing by itself accounted for 57% of healthcare cyber incidents in 2020 (27) â€“ a sharp increase from 32% just 4 years prior (6).





# Phishing attacks

Phishing is a form of cyberattack that sends a message, usually by email, to the victim. The message is crafted, through methods of social engineering, to trick the victim to go to a specific website or download a file in such a way that malware may access the victims system. 

One way of tricking the victim might be to make the message appear to be from a known or reliable source that the victim might care about. 

The messages might be crafted manually, targeting a specific victim (spear phishing), or they might be automatically generated attempting to reach as large an audience as possible.

## Early days
Cybersecurity used to defence. Build a castle that was impenetrable.

## Modern times
Can't prevent all attacks. Now make "assumptions of compromise"


# Threat hunting
Threat hunting is an organized, systematic approach of seeking out indicators of compromise on our networks using expertise and analytic techniques. Emerged from 2016 and outwards.

## Begin with hypothesis

## Indicators of compromise
- Unusual binary files.
- Unexpected processes or resources consumption
- Deviations in network
- Unexplained log entries
- Unapproved configuration changes


Searching for indicators is the core of threat hunting. If found, move into incident response -> containment -> erradicatin -> recovery.

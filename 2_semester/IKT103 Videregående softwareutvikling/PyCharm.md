# About PyCharm (information only)

PyCharm is an IDE, an integrated development environment. In short this is a tool to create programs. It is where you do the actual day to day programming. To make a comparison; Word is a program to create documents, PyCharm is a program to create programs.

# About the Python Interpreter (information only)

An interpreter is a program that takes your code (text) and runs it. You must have an interpreter to run the code you write. PyCharm does not come with a built-in interpreter, so we will have to install one separately.

# 1. Installing an interpreter (done once per machine)

Windows: [Click to download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe) then install Python 3. Make sure to select “Add python to path”.


# 2. Installing JetBrains Toolbox App + PyCharm  
(done once per machine)

If you have JetBrains Toolbox installed from a previous course you can install PyCharm now.

If you do not have JetBrains ToolBox App installed do so now:

You must register at this link with your UiA e-mail address to get a free license:

  Once you are registered you can download the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/) and install PyCharm Professional from there. You will use other tools from JetBrains in other courses and those can also be installed from the Toolbox.

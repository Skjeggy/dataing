## Title: Cryptography in Pacemakers.

## Introduction - 50-100 ord
What is a pacemaker?
	- Embedded device, resource constraints -> not enough resources for same cryptography as elsewhere. 
Why is security important in pacemakers.
Recent developments in vulenerabilities, etc.

## Types of cryptographic protocols used in pacemakers - 50-100 ord


## Concrete example of one of them - 200-300 ord
Blockchain ? "In this paper, we introduce Medical Implant Consent (MedIC), a non-embedded, blockchain-based solution that provides authentication and authorization according to patient consent. We design protocols for doctors to obtain digital medical licenses and for patients to obtain and verify digital patient consent. We evaluate the performance and cost of our solution, using time measurements and memory footprint of relevant operations. We also enumerate our cryptographic operations and compute the energy with benchmarked measurements. Our results demonstrate a memory footprint of 4436 MB and timing delay of 200 ms to authenticate according to our patientâ€™s consent"

# Patches
Patches protect against many cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 
Regular security patches are important.

# Undiscovered vulnerabilities
Always a threat. When they are discovered, there are a few outcomes:

## 1) Ethical disclosure
1. Notify vendor of vulnerability
2. Provide vendor a reasonable amount of time to create patch
3. Disclose the vulnerability publicly.

## 2) Zero-day vulnerability 
Vulnerabilities that are discovered, but kept secret and used as weapons. No patch has been released to fixed it, since nobody knows about it yet.
Difficult to exploit since you have to be one of the few who knows, as well as having the skills to use it. APT ([[Cybersecurity adversaries]]) are more likely to use these as they are well funded and work methodically to figure out these vulnerabilities. 

Possible defence against APT groups:
- Build strong security foundation
- Implement strong encryption
- Use rigerous monitoring

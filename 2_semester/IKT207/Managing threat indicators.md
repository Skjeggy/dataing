[[Threat indicators]]

Threat info is only useful if we share it.

Sharing manually is tiresome. Therefore it should be more automatised. There are a few services offering this.

## Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX)
Helps us understand what properties to use when describing threats to others.

## Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)
Standardised and structured language to communicate security information between systems and organizations.
Takes the properties that CybOX gives us and structures them in a standerdized manner.

## Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicators Information (TAXII)

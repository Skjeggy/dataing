To obtain services from the operating system, a user program must make a **system call**, which traps into the kernel and invokes the operating system. The TRAP instruction switches from user mode to kernel mode and starts the operating system. When the work has been completed, control is returned to the user program at the instruction following the system call.
For the time being, think of it as a special kind of procedure call that has the additional property of switching from user mode to kernel mode.

## Introduction
Threat intelligence is a set of activities that an organization undertakes to educate itself about changes in cybersecurity threat landscape, and adapt security controls based on that information.

## Open-source intelligence
Uses public information, but it is time consuming to stay updated. 
- Security websites
- Vulnerability databases
- News media
- Social media
- Dark Web
- Information sharing centers
- File repositories
- Code repositories
- Security researchers

## Email Address harvesting
Searches for valid email adresses.

## Security companies 
Often offer closed sources threat intelligence solutions for a fee. Samme som i finansverdenen eller medisin. 

## How to evaluate if a source is good?
- Timeliness (how soon from threat to published info on the source)
- Accuracy (is source correct?)
- Reliability (is the source consistent?)

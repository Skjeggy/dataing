#threat_intelligence 

Threat research uses [[Threat intelligence]] to get inside the mind of their adversaries.

Two types:

## Reputational threat research
Identify potentially malicious actors based on their use of IP adress, mail adress, domains etc. that were previously used in attacks.

You look like a criminal, so you must be a criminal. You have a bad reputation and are not trustworthy

## Behavioral threat research
Identify potentially malicious actors based on behavior similar to past attackers.  

Combine both of these for powerful results.

## Research sources

#social_engineering_attacks 

When all the animals go to the same watering hole, they are vulnerable. Same online with a gang of similar users all using a webpage they trust.

Websites spread malware effectively. Browser add-ons often have vulnerabilities. Users are conditioned to click "OK" on security warnings.

## Limitations
Attackers can't just build their own websites - why would users visit the website ? 


# How it works:

## Step 1 - Identify and compromise a highly targeted webiste

## Step 2 - Choose a client exploit and bundle in a botnet

## Step 3 - Place the malware on the compromised website

## Step 4 - Sit back and wait for infected systems to phone home.

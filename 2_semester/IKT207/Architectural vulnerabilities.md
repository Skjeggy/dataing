#vulnerability_types 

Poor design of systems. Fundamental flaws that are difficult to fix. 

# IT architecture
Processes and practices used to design systems. Security important.
Incorporate security early, avoid bolt-on requirements later.

Untrained users and weak business processes are just as dangerous as technical flaws.

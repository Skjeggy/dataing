#penetration_testing 

Open security testing. Encourages testers/hackers/attackers to report bugs in orderly fashion in exchange for a reward. 

A bug bounty program can be organized in house or delegated to a vendor.
Vendors offer self-managed or fully-managed bounty programs. 

Good way to discover previously unknown vulnerabilities.

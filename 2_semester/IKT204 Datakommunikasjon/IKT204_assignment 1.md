Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the switch and between the switch and the receiving host are **_R_1** and **_R_2**, respectively. Assuming the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length _L_? (Ignore queuing, propagation delay, and processing delay.

### Svar
Packet switches : 1
Transmission rates between sending host and switch: R_1
Transmission rates between sending host and switch: R_2
Store-and-forward packet switching. 

What is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length L ?

$$\text{Total end-to-end delay} = \frac{L}{R_1} + \frac{L}{R_2}  $$

Propagation delay and transmission delay are two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate **_R_** bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by **_m_** meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is **_s_** meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size **_L_** bits to Host B.

### **a)** Express the propagation delay, **_d_prop**, in terms of **_m_** and **_s_**. 


### **b)** Determine the transmission time of the packet, **_d_trans**, in terms of **_L_** and **_R_**.  
### **c)** Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.  
### **d)** Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time **_t_ = 0**. At time **_t_ = _d_trans**, where is the last bit of the packet?  
### **e)** Suppose **_d_prop** is greater than **_d_trans**. At time **_t_ = _d_trans**, where is the first bit of the packet?  
### **f)** Suppose **_d_prop** is less than **_d_trans**. At time **_t_ = _d_trans**, where is the first bit of the packet?  
### **g)** Suppose **_s_** = 2.5 **.** 108 m/s, **_L_** = 1500 bytes, and **_R_** = 20 Mbps, where M is SI standard (base 10) 106 and not binary (base 2) 220 = 10242. Find the distance **_m_** so that **_d_prop** equals **_d_trans**.

**Ch. 1.7. (10 points)  
**Consider the network illustrated in Figure 1.16. Assume the two hosts on the left of the figure start transmitting packets of 1500 bytes at the same time towards Router B. Suppose the link rates between the hosts and the Router A is 4 Mbps, where M is SI standard (base 10) 106 and not binary (base 2) 220 = 10242. One link has a 2 milliseconds propagation delay and the other has a 3 milliseconds propagation delay. Link rate between Router A and Router B is 100 Mbps. Assume neglectable processing delay at Router A (**_dprocRouterA_ ≈ 0**) and its outbound queue towards Router B is currently empty. Will queuing delay occur in Router A? Support your answer with calculations.

**Consider a user who needs to upload 1 GB of data to a server, where G is SI standard (base 10) 109 and not binary (base 2) 230 = 10243. The user lives in a small town where only 56 kbps dial-up access is available. A bus visits the small town once a day from the closest city 150 km away and stops in front of the user’s house. The bus has a 100 Mbps Wi-Fi connection. It can collect data from users in rural areas and transfer them to the Internet through a 1 Gbps link once it gets back to the city. Suppose average speed of the bus is 60 km/h.

**a)** How long is the upload time when using dial-up internet access?  
**b)** How long is the upload time when using the bus?  
**c)** What is the fastest way for the user to transfer the data to the server?

SQL injection is a common attack vector to access information that is not intended to be displayed, through SQL code manipulation of the backend database. This information can be sensitive company data and private customer details. If a company is exposed to a SQL injection it could have huge consequences. A successful SQL injection could result in the unauthorized viewing of user list, them gaining administrative rights to a database and they could delete an entire table. [1] There are several vulnerabilities that makes a web site or application vulnerable to SQL injection. Some examples are, the application does not filter, validate, or sanitize user supplied data. The tables/database structure is available within the dynamic SQL command. The source code has not been reviewed and there has been no penetration testing on the website or application. Therefore, SQL injection occurs when there is information about the database scheme the code on the web site or application and user input is allowed into a SQL statement without it filtering out dangerous characters. [2] To prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities in web sites or web applications, developers can utilize parameterized database queries with bound, careful use of parameterized stored procedures which are in the database and typed parameters. There are multiple steps developers can take to prevent and minimize attacks. For example, they can keep web server software, libraries, database server software, frameworks, and plug-ins up to date with the latest patches available. They should not use a shared database between different applications or web sites. [3] Input filtering and escaping is not enough to prevent SQL injection, this is a common misconception. Input filtering can stop some of the attacks, but it does not fix the vulnerability. Input filtering can in many cases be evaded by the attackers, leaving your web application vulnerable. [3] Parameterized queries are one of the most common ways to protect a web site or application against SQL injection. It encapsulates and parameterize the SQL commands. This is a technique that separates the SQL query from the user input. IKT113 â€“ Self Study 1 This means the values are parameters and can no longer contain executable code. That meaning the code is a literal value and is checked for the type and length. [2] There are different types of SQL injection attacks. In-band SQLi is known as the classic SQL injection and is when the hackers use the same channel or band to launch database errors to collect results from an SQL injection. Inferential SQLi is known as a blind injection and is when attackers send payloads of data to a database to observe its response and behavior, without seeing what is occurring in the database. This gives the attackers clues, and they can adjust their strategy on how to access the information in the database. [4]

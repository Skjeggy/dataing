Malware is mostly known for its threat to security, malware stands for malicious software and its an evil software. There are several types of malware software, but they can firstly be separated in two “Propagation mechanism” and “payload”. The most common types of malware are computer virus, worms, backdoors, logic bombs and lastly a widely known the trojan horse. These are great threats to computer security, and they should not be underestimated. This essay is going to go a bit deeper into the specific malware called backdoors, and hopefully get an insight on what backdoors are, how they are used and lastly why they can be such a huge threat for the computer security. Backdoors are not independent programs made by developers whose interest is to deliver a malicious payload, backdoors are a way of gaining unauthorized access of the root of an application. The main way of entering through a backdoor is to use help from a trojan horse. This way a user can be downloading a file that contains a malware without knowing, and the second they open the file the imposter can gain access of personal files and you have the risk of getting your files encrypted until a ransom is paid. This is called ransomware. Another thing about backdoors is that when an imposter has gained access, he can then grant access to other. This could be risky if it falls into the wrong hands. Backdoors don’t necessarily have to be malicious. Backdoors can be used to benefit programmers and access own files faster with a “key”. This is also a way to save a user if they lose access of their own system. The negative side of backdoors are if they gain access, then they can see your actions, what you type, your passwords and sensitive information that a user would not want to get leaked. The fact that backdoors work in the background means that it is hiding and then makes it harder to detect and therefore makes it hard to know if you are infected at all. Conclusion: What we can conclude from this text is that there are so many ways of losing access of personal details, and that there are many ways of being under a threat. This itself should be a warning for every user that there are so many imposters out on the web that are ready to infect your devices to gain something from it. As mentioned backdoor entry is one way of doing this, but I can also be classified as a resource since it is not necessarily a threat if you use it in the right way. There are ways of protecting yourself such as being critical to the sources you are using, downloading from shady places and lastly don’t click links that seem safe.

Automating threat intelligence provides tremendous benefits.

## Examples
- Automate blacklisting of IP adresses from threat feeds
	- Use first in alert only mode if concerned that automatic blocking will cause service disruptions
	- Combine different threat feeds for better filtering

## Incident response
Usually a manual process. Now being automated.  

## Data enrichment 
Automatically supplements incident data. 

Examples: 
- Perform source address reconnaissance
- Retrieve related log records
- Trigger vulnerability scan

Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms enhance SIEM capabilities.

Machine learning provides interesting possibilities concerning automated creation of malware signatures.

For a readable discussion of peering and customer-provider relationships, see [Van der Berg 2008]. Along these same lines, a third-party company can create an Internet Exchange Point (IXP), which is a meeting point where multiple ISPs can peer together. An IXP is typically in a stand-alone building with its own switches [Ager 2012].

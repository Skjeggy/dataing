**Normalization** is a database design technique that reduces [[Data redundancy|data redundancy]] and eliminates undesirable characteristics like [[Insertion]], [[Update]] and [[Deletion]] Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate [[Data redundancy|redundant (repetitive) data]] and ensure data is stored logically.

## Normal forms
- [[1NF (First Normal Form)]]
- [[2NF (Second Normal Form)]]
- [[3NF (Third Normal Form)]] 

The Theory of Data Normalization in MySQL server is still being developed further. For example, there are discussions even on 6th Normal Form. **However, in most practical applications, normalization achieves its best in 3rd Normal Form**.

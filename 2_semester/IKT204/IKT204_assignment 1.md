## Ch. 1.1. (10 points)  
Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the switch and between the switch and the receiving host areÂ **_R_1**Â andÂ **_R_2**, respectively. Assuming the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of lengthÂ _L_? (Ignore queuing, propagation delay, and processing delay.

### Svar
Packet switches : 1
Transmission rates between sending host and switch: R_1
Transmission rates between sending host and switch: R_2
Store-and-forward packet switching. 

What is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length L ?

$$\text{Total end-to-end delay} = \frac{L}{R_1} + \frac{L}{R_2}  $$

**Describe how a botnet can be created, and how it can be used for a DDoS attack.

## Ch. 1.6. (10 points)  
Propagation delay and transmission delay are two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rateÂ **_R_**Â bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated byÂ **_m_**Â meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link isÂ **_s_**Â meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of sizeÂ **_L_**Â bits to Host B.

### **a)**Â Express the propagation delay,Â **_d_prop**, in terms ofÂ **_m_**Â andÂ **_s_**. 

#### Svar:
Host A sends a packat of size L (bits) to Host B which is m meters away, using a link of rate R (bps) with propegation speed along the link being s (meters/second). What is the propegation delay in terms of m and s ? 

Since the propegation delay is $$ d_\text{prop} = \frac{d}{s} $$ where d is the distance between Host A and Host B, in other words m, and s is the propegation speed of the link, in other words s. Thus,

$$ d_\text{prop} = \frac{m}{s} $$

### **b)**Â Determine the transmission time of the packet,Â **_d_trans**, in terms ofÂ **_L_**Â andÂ **_R_**.  


### **c)**Â Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.  


### **d)**Â Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at timeÂ **_t_Â = 0**. At timeÂ **_t_Â =Â _d_trans**, where is the last bit of the packet?  


### **e)**Â SupposeÂ **_d_prop**Â is greater thanÂ **_d_trans**. At timeÂ **_t_Â =Â _d_trans**, where is the first bit of the packet?  


### **f)**Â SupposeÂ **_d_prop**Â is less thanÂ **_d_trans**. At timeÂ **_t_Â =Â _d_trans**, where is the first bit of the packet?  


### **g)**Â SupposeÂ **_s_**Â = 2.5Â **.**Â 108Â m/s,Â **_L_**Â = 1500 bytes, andÂ **_R_**Â = 20 Mbps, where M is SI standard (base 10) 106Â andÂ notÂ binary (base 2) 220Â = 10242. Find the distanceÂ **_m_**Â so thatÂ **_d_prop**Â equalsÂ **_d_trans**.

## **Ch. 1.7. (10 points)  
**Consider the network illustrated in Figure 1.16. Assume the two hosts on the left of the figure start transmitting packets of 1500 bytes at the same time towards Router B. Suppose the link rates between the hosts and the Router A is 4 Mbps, where M is SI standard (base 10) 106Â andÂ notÂ binary (base 2) 220Â = 10242. One link has a 2 milliseconds propagation delay and the other has a 3 milliseconds propagation delay. Link rate between Router A and Router B is 100 Mbps. Assume neglectable processing delay at Router A (**_dprocRouterA_Â â‰ˆ 0**) and its outbound queue towards Router B is currently empty. Will queuing delay occur in Router A? Support your answer with calculations.

## **Ch. 1.8. (15 points)  
**Consider a user who needs to upload 1 GB of data to a server, where G is SI standard (base 10) 109Â andÂ notÂ binary (base 2) 230Â = 10243. The user lives in a small town where only 56 kbps dial-up access is available. A bus visits the small town once a day from the closest city 150 km away and stops in front of the userâ€™s house. The bus has a 100 Mbps Wi-Fi connection. It can collect data from users in rural areas and transfer them to the Internet through a 1 Gbps link once it gets back to the city. Suppose average speed of the bus is 60 km/h.

### **a)**Â How long is the upload time when using dial-up internet access?  
### **b)**Â How long is the upload time when using the bus?  
### **c)**Â What is the fastest way for the user to transfer the data to the server?

## **Ch. 1.9. (10 points)  
**A few questions from the history of the Internet.

### **a)**Â What historical event took place on January 1, 1983?  
FÃ¸rste gang internet ble "skrudd pÃ¥" (IPS protokollen kjÃ¸rte) via ARPANET, av US Department of Defence. 

January 1, 1983 saw the official deployment of TCP/IP as the new standard host protocol for ARPAnet (replacing the NCP protocol). The transition [RFC 801] from NCP to TCP/IP was a flag day eventâ€”all hosts were required to transfer over to TCP/IP as of that day. 

### **b)**Â Who is known as the inventor of the World Wide Web (WWW).  

### **c)**Â Which protocols did this person specify?

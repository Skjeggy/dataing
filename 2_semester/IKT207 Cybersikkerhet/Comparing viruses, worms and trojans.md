#malware


Two things in common:

- [[Propagation mechanism]]
- [[Payload]]

## Virus
Spreads via human action.
User education is best prevention.

## Worms
Spreads via own action, by themselves. Require vulnerable systems. 
Best protection: update systems.

>[!example]
>- First worm in 1988, affected 10% of the internet. Eye opener.
>- Stuxnet infected iranian nuclear facility. Crossed virtual/physical barrier - damaged equipment.

## Trojan horse
Disguise themselves as beneficial programs. Acts as advertised when run, delivers payload behind the scenes. 
Best protection: application control

>[!note]
> Remote Acess Trojans (RAT)  - provide backdoors to hacked systems.

# Insider threat
Risk of internal compromise.

Often employees current or earlier, contractors etc. with temporary access.
About 50% of security breaches in organizations. Often more costly. Often people with skills, like IT professionals etc.

# Privelege Escalation Attacks
Elevate access from i.e. user to administrator access. 
Common users might have skills you don't know about. Or friends of theirs.
- Do background checks
- Only give minimum priveleges. On a need basis.
- Require multiple users to carry out sensitive operations (two keys for one lock kind of thing)
- Implement mandatory vacation for critical staff - when they aren't at the office, they can't cover up  their exploits.

# Shadow IT
Technology brought into the organization by users without approval of tech leaders. Can expose company to risk.

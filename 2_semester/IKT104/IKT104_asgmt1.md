# Assignment 1 - Getting started
- [ ] Finish Assignement 1 ðŸ“… 2023-01-22

## Introduction

This first assignment exists mostly to verify that the tools work as they should and for you to get familiar with the kit. You will also learn how to communicate between the microcontroller to the PC using serial communication, and to control an LED with a digital output.

**NOTE:**Â If Mbed Studio fails to upload your program to the board you might be using a charging cable, not a data cable. You can try a different cable before you ask for help.

## Preparation

1.  CompleteÂ [Course preparations](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/12507/pages/course-preparations "Course preparations")Â if you haven't already. Every member of the group should do this.  

2.  Go to yourÂ _<course folder>_Â and create new folderÂ _assignments_. You should avoid comitting and pushing large folders. Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (OSX/Linux), go toÂ _<course folder>/assignments_Â and enter the following command:Â 

```
echo -e "BUILD\nmbed-os\n.mbed\n.github\n*.md" > .gitignore
```

3.  Open Mbed Studio and select yourÂ _<course folder>/assignments_Â as workspace. Connect the development board to the PC or select target DISCO-L475VG-IOT01A (B-L475E-IOT01A). Create a new program based on exampleÂ _mbed-os-example-blinky-baremetal_Â and name the programÂ _assignment_1_. Now instead of storing the Mbed OS in the program folder, select link to the existing shared Mbed OS git repository you created duringÂ [Course preparations](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/12507/pages/course-preparations "Course preparations")Â and add program. You should now have the first assignment located atÂ _<course folder>/assignments/assignment_1_.  
      
	If you rather selectÂ _mbed-os-example-blinky_Â in stead of the bare metal example, you will include lots of libraries for connectivity (BLE, Cellular, LoRaWAN, WiFi, NFC) and Internet protocols which we will not use at this stage, but the compile time will be huge (depending on of how powerfull your PC is). This can be avoided if you download file Â [mbedignore_no_network_connectivity.zip](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/12507/files/2028962?wrap=1 "mbedignore_no_network_connectivity.zip")Â [Last ned mbedignore_no_network_connectivity.zip](https://uia.instructure.com/courses/12507/files/2028962/download?download_frd=1), unzip and addÂ _.mbedignore_Â file next to yourÂ _main.cpp_Â file in the project.  
      
    
4.  Make sureÂ _assignment_1_Â is selected as the active program. Build the program (pressÂ _the-blue-hammer-button_) and check the console output for errors. If everything is fine, upload the program (pressÂ _the-blue-play-button_) to the microcontroller and verify it is running OK (there should be one LED blinking on the development board).

## Requirements

In this assignment you will create a program that lets you control an LED from the PC by pressing the 0 or 1 keys.

1.  25% Connect an LED (not blue) to an output with an appropriate resistor
2.  10% Configure the IO as output
3.  10% Configure the serial port with baud rate 115200
4.  10% Read 1 byte from the serial port:
    -   15% If the byte is '0' turn the led off
    -   15% If the byte is '1' turn the led on
    -   15% Do this forever

## Testing

To test the program you must first upload it to the microcontroller. When the development board is connected to your PC, aÂ _Serial Monitor_Â tab should be seen in the IDE. If not pressÂ _View_Â and select theÂ _Serial Monitor_, then press a key to send that key to the microcontroller. If the printout is corrupt, make sure that the baud rate is set to 115200.Â 

## Delivery

Deliverer the following as text in Canvas:

-   Link to Bitbucket where to code has been delivered.  
    Directly to the file if there is only 1, or the directory if more than 1.  
    Navigate to the delivery atÂ [https://tools.uia.no/bitbucketÂ Links to an external site.](https://tools.uia.no/bitbucket)and copy the URL from the browser.
-   Link to YouTube (or other video service) with video showing each of the requirements.  
    You don't need to show the actual code, just which of the requirements are met.

#vulnerability_types 

Security issues may arise in supply chain.

End of life analysis -> Running products that lack support (patches etc) present a significant security risk.

# End of sale
Product will no longer be sold, but support will continue.

# End of support
Vendor will reduce or stop support of a product.

# End of life
Vendor will no longer support the product. No support, no updates.

# Vendor failure
Sometimes vendors fail to provide necessary updates. Example: embedded systems.

# Mitigate the risk
Use trustworthy vendors that are reliable. Use backups.

definition:: a mathematical function that converts a variable-length input into a fixed length input.


# Hash function criteria

- It must produce a completely different output for each input
- It must be computationally difficult to retrieve input from the output - irreversible
- It must be computationally difficult to find two different inputs that generate the same output - collisions - i.e. [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).

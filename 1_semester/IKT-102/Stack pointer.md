A stack pointer is a small register that stores the memory address of the last data [element](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/element) added to the stack or, in some cases, the first available address in the stack. A [stack](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/stack) is a specialized buffer that is used by a program's functions to store data such as parameters, local [variables](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/variable) and other function-related information. The stack pointer -- also referred to as the extended stack pointer (ESP) -- ensures that the program always adds data to the right location in the stack.

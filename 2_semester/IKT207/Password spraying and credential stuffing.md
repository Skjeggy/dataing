# Password spraying
Exploits common passwords. Uses them to attempt to login several places at once. 
Best defence is to prohibit using common passwords.

# Credential stuffing
Exploits reused passwords.
If an attacker gains a password from a low security site, they can try it against a high security site. 

Best defence is to avoid reusing passwords. Do this through password managers, generating and maintaining unique passwords.

# Multifactor authentication (i.e. 2FA)
Helps defend against both.

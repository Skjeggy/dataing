One of the biggest security vulnerabilities in a system or program, is one the vendor doesn’t know about. A Zero -Day vulnerability is a security weakness in a software or system that is unknown for those responsible for patching or securing the system. The phrase “Zero-Days” describes a vulnerability that is unidentified and for which there are “zero days” to address and correct the problem before it may be exploited. APTs or other malicious actors may take advantage of this vulnerability to get into the system or steal sensitive data. Zero-day vulnerabilities can have multiple states: 1. Unknown: Nobody is aware of the vulnerability, and it has not yet been exploited. 2. 0-Day: At least one individual is aware of the vulnerability, but no one else does. This someone could be the attacker who found it, or it could be a researcher who discovered it but hasn’t yet disclosed it. 3. N-day: Although the vulnerability is widely known, there is currently no patch. This can happen if a researcher has informed the vendor of the vulnerability, but the vendor has not yet made a patch available. 4. Patched: The vendor is aware of the vulnerability, and a patch is available to address it. 5. Exploited: The vulnerability is being actively exploited by an attacker. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a category of cyber assault in which a hacker creates a sustained presence on a compromised system to collect confidential information. APTs are frequently used to steal confidential government information or intellectual property. They are typically carried out by state-sponsored actors or wellfunded criminal groups. You have Lazarus group that is tied to the North Korean government. There is also the APT group called Fancy Bear, the reason that made this group so famous, was the interfering with Hilary Clintons presidential campaign in 2016. [1] Exploiting zero-day flaws is one method used by APT attackers to enter a system. The system security staff is unaware of these flaws, which can be utilized to penetrate a network. Once inside, the attacker can utilize the infected machine, as a jumping off point for other assaults, data theft or establishing a botnet. Government and financial institutions are organizations that are highly concerned about APT assaults. Sensitive data loss, monetary loss and reputational harm are just a few of the severe effects that can result from these assaults. Organizations must use multi-layered strategy to security to safeguard against APT assaults. This entails putting in place robust perimeter security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as well as deploying endpoint security products to safeguard specific systems. Organizations should also implement incident response strategies and provide regular security training for staff members. Keeping up with emerging zero-day vulnerabilities and patching systems as soon as they released are two crucial steps that enterprises may take to defend themselves against APT assaults. Given the difficulty in identifying zero-day vulnerabilities, this can be problematic. Organizations may, however, subscribe to vulnerability intelligence feeds and utilize technologies that are automated to check for vulnerabilities. In conclusion, firms that manage sensitive data should be very concerned about zero-day vulnerabilities and advanced persistent threats. Organizations must take precautions against these vulnerabilities to defend their networks since zero-day vulnerabilities are a crucial point of entry for APT attackers. These include of putting in place an incident response strategy, performing regular security training, establishing a multi-layered security approach, remaining up to date on emerging vulnerabilities, and patching systems as soon as patches are made available.

Grammar is good and there are no obvious typos that I can find. 

## Hva går utover det som gis av info i videoene
Multiple states ? Naming different APT groups and their exploits. Mer av dette ?

Mye "generell" og "common sense" info. 

Hadde vært gøyere å lese om det var mer av spesifikke detaljer eller dybde innenfor et aspekt. F.eks. interfering with Hilary Clinton presidential campaign - how ? 
Hvordan har ATP grupper påvirket forskjellige myndigheter eller financial groups ?



Bibliography seems to be missing the name of the articles. dobbeltsjekk stil.

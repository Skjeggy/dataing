#Vulnerability_scanning 

On reviewing scanner reports.

# Prioritization factors
- Vulnerability severity
- System criticality
- Information sensitivity
- Remediation difficulty
- System exposure

# Vulnerability Validation
Is the vulnerability actually real ? False positive ? 


Just like in medicine - true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative.

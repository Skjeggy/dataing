In general, phishing is the most common delivery method (23) for offenders to infiltrate healthcare systems, with 89% of cybercrimes being initiated via phishing emails (27). The number of attackers who rely on social engineering has risen 25% since 2019, and phishing by itself accounted for 57% of healthcare cyber incidents in 2020 (27) â€“ a sharp increase from 32% just 4 years prior (6).





# Phishing attacks through websites.

Phishing is a form of cyberattack that sends a message, usually by email, to the victim. The message is crafted, through methods of social engineering, to trick the victim to go to a specific website and or download a file in such a way that malware may access the victims system. 

One way of tricking the victim might be to make the message appear to be from a known or reliable source that the victim might care about. 

The messages might be crafted manually, targeting a specific victim (i.e. spear phishing or whale phishing), or they might be automatically generated attempting to reach as large an audience as possible.

## status
In recent times, phishing attacks commonly use specially designed fake websites to trick victims into divulging sensitive data such as login information, financial information or other exploitable information. Such websites serve as common entry points for online engineering attacks. 

A typical phishing attack like this has four stages. To start with, the attacker sets up a fake website posing as an authentic one. Then, a URL is distributed to the target victim(s). The  victim is then tempted to visit the fake website. Finally the victim enters valuable data as input. 

The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), which follows the global development of phishing attacks, reported that in the 3rd quarter of 2022 they counted as many as 1,270,883 total phishing attacks, which is a new record compared to earlier numbers. [[@APWGPhishingActivity]]

## How to defend against phishing attacks.

There are several ways to combat phishing attacks. 

One is through educating potential victims. For  businesses, this involves training their employees to better identify phishing emails. This training can take many forms, including games and simulated phishing attacks. 

Another important way to combat phishing is through legal action towards attackers using phishing attacks and similar methods to perform cybercrime. This might act as deterrents for more causal phishers.

On the more technical side, black and white listing is an important measure to combat phishing attacks. This involves either black listing a large list of domain names or URLs that are either suspicious or known to be harmful sites. 

there are methods ranging from heuristic detection and visual similarity detection to using advanced machine learning algorithms to detect both phishing emails and discrepancies between authentic websites and fake phishing websites. [[@alabdanPhishingAttacksSurvey2020]]

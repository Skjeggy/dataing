A **KEY in SQL** is a value used to identify records in a table uniquely. An SQL KEY is a single column or combination of multiple columns used to uniquely identify rows or tuples in the table. SQL Key is used to identify duplicate information, and it also helps establish a relationship between multiple tables in the database.

Note: Columns in a table that are NOT used to identify a record uniquely are called non-key columns.

#Understanding_attackers, #APTs

# Differentiating attackers
- Internal vs external. Internal are often more dangerous given level of legitimate access.
- Level of sophistication (from amateurs to professionals)
	- Script kiddies - unskilled hackers that run other peoples scripts instead of creating own.
- Access to resources 
- Motivation
	- Hacktivists
	- Criminal syndicates (ransomware, financial gain)
	- Competitors of the business, corporate espionage.
	- Nation-state actors sponsor advanced persistence threat groups (APT groups or APTs), often military. Can target other governments, companies etc.
- Intent

## Defence
Script kiddies are defeated by basic means: 
- Regular updates 
- Firewalls
- Intrusion prevention systems.

- White hats - good guys. Operate with permission and good intent. Fix flaws in security. 
- Grey hats - somewhere in the middle. Operate without permission but with good intent.
- Black hats - bad guys. Operate without permission and with malicious intent.

#Understanding_attackers 

# Attack Vectors
Provides an attack path.

## Email
One of the most common paths.
- Phishing mails
- Mails with malicious content. A single users mistake can open up the door to a whole lot of trouble.

## Social media
- Can spread malware
- Can yield trust that can later be abused.

## Removable media
USB drives etc. Leave a drive in a public place, hope that someone plugs it into their device which then delivers the malware.
Similarly malware can be placed in chips in USB charging cables 

## Card Skimmers
For reading magnetic cards and using them in card cloning attacks.

## Cloud services
Cloud services are routinely scanned to look for improperly secured content and systems.

## Unsecure network access points (jets)
Can grant access to networks and systems, which can then be compromised.

## Wireless networks
Easy path. Can be accessed from parking lots or other similar locations. 

## Physical
You must assume that a hacker can take control of anything they can physically touch.
Can also be done through tampering with the supply chain, creating backdoors.
